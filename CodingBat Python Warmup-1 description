This is the result of me doing every practice problem in the warmup-1 section of the python problems on codingbat.com. These problems are 
extremely easy, and it didn't take much time for me to solve them. I organized each problem with the name commented at the top with the 
codingbat.com description of it below and my solution at the bottom. I might turn this into it's own branch for me to do all the other
codingbat problems on, but for now I'll take the easy commits.
