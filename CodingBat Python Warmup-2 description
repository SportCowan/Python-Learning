Level 2 is definitely harder than Level 1 for codingbat.com. This took me about 20 minutes to complete and a few of the problems really made me think. I 
also misinterpreted the last one a little bit so I was confused about why it was wrong for a while, but I figured it out after a few minutes. Some of them
were still Level 1, but the Level 2 ones were definitely the next level up. Overall very cool.
