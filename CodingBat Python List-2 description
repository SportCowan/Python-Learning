It seems like the general theme of theses codingbat level 2's is that they have a couple that are just as easy as level 1's and several that
are far harder. This one was the hardest so far, and took me about 30 minutes. I onoly have the logic Level 2 left noe, so I'll get that done 
by the end of the day, and hopefully tomorrow I can start and finish the milestone two project. Anyways, this be cool and sometimes more 
difficult than it would be if I were in java or c++, but I'm still smiling after being awake for 29ish hours.
