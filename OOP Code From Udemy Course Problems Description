These are my solutions to the problems in the Udmy course's Object Oriented Programming unit. This was insanely easy and took me about 10 minutesd total.
I'm glad I get 2 free contributions off this so now I can do some more exercises where I actually have to spend some time. Interestingly enough, none of 
the problems required me to use inheritence, so hopefully when that comes up I'm not completely screwed. I think I'll be fine though.
