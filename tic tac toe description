This was the first milestone project in the python udemy course I am taking. This was written in Python using Jupiter Notebook, and is run by running the 
method play_game() in a new line. I definitely didn't choose the best way to make it, but I wanted it to be very readable rather than efficient. Also, the
clear_screen() method which is unique to Jupiter Notebook for some reason made the game have a weird format at player 2's 4th move. I can't figure out why
that happens, but also if you just get rid of that method entirely the game works fine. It just creates new lines to print the next board on rather than 
replacing those lines. Finally, I'm a braindead monkey and forgot to make it so that "x" always goes first. Instead, player 1 always goes first, and I'm too
lazy to fix that considering nobody is ever going to see this. I've already spent 3 hours just fixing certain weird things that I don't really know about yet
since I've only just started learning python.
