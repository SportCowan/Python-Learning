These are my solutions to the codingbat.com python list-1 exercises, and wow those were easy. Like, return the first 3 digits of pi in a list? 
This website is for babies lol. However I do need to maybe think a little bit aboout how to do that move left thingy more generally rather than 
doing it only by knowing the length of the list. Other than that, I'm really getting used to the syntax of python and how easy things are to do 
int his silly language.
