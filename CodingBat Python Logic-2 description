Well I finally finished the codingbat stuff. Again some of the level 2 stuff really required me to think (particularly with how fried my brain is). This
was pretty cool I'd say. I'm definitely a lot more comfortable with how python works now. Every file of actual code is formatted the same way. I got a 
correct solution on every problem in codingbat python. Maybe sometime I'll do the java stuff on there to brush up on some of that stuff. Anyways, Imma
eat dinner and get right to bed I've been awake for 30 and a half hours.
