These are my soltuions for the CodingBat Python String-2 problems. Acouple of these took some effort, but overall I would say they were comparable 
in difficulty to warmup-2, which makes sense. At this point I'm no longer worried about dont it "the best way" (although I think I did for most of
them anyways), rather I am merely trying to make it work. This took about 20 minutes to complete. Spotify has a lot of ads. I might want to invest 
in premium.
