These were the harderst of the codingbat.com python level 1 problems by quite a bit. However that isn't saying much. There were less problems, but
it still took me around 12-15 minutes to complete all of them. At the end of the day these aren't meant to be hard. They're just for me to farm
contributions while getting locked into the python syntax. Over time I'll be doing more complicated stuff. It would be kinda cool to do a coding
competition someday. For now though, let's do level 2 problems :).
